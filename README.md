# 3D Image Card Gallery

This project showcases a 3D image card gallery with interactive hover effects and sound. The images are displayed in a list, and each card reacts to hover events with 3D transformations and brightness adjustments, creating a dynamic and immersive user experience. Additionally, a sound effect is triggered when the user hovers over the gallery.
